# MNIST-USING-GAN
In this I have done a basics of GAN in which we have Generated digits using MINST. As new Digit dosen't make any sense hence it is come under Conditional GAN.
I have imported MNIST dataset.
Using pytorch framework
Used two part generator and dicriminator
Generator makes new images from the given dataset and try to fool discriminator
Discriminator only task is to classify images as whehter a images  is fake(as it was made by generator or not) ot real(as it is from dataset)res
Rest I have used acivation function as Linear function and LeakyRelu in discrinimator and generator to train a model (dropout to prevent overfitting)
BinaryCrossEntropyLoss(BCE loss) which claculate the  fake loss (loss in which discriminator predict fake images as generated by generator as real images) and real loss (loss in which discriminator predict real images as generated by generator as fake images)
We use Adam as an optimizer in both disriminator and generator
